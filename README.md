# 🐍 VGA Game & HDL Graphics Project

> A Snake-inspired, **hardware-based game** written in Verilog that processes inputs from a game controller and outputs graphics on a **VGA display** — built using VGA Playground.

This repository is for anyone interested in how the VGA system works, verilog and chip design.

I'll walk through how I built this project as a **tutorial** for those who want to make their own VGA game! 🎮
